Strategic Recommendations
1.	Seasonal Campaigns: Strengthen marketing efforts during low-revenue months (April–June) to balance sales distribution across the year.
2.	Product Bundling: Cross-sell and bundle mid-performing products like Cakes and Sweets with top sellers to increase basket size.
3.	Regional Growth Strategy: Focus on underperforming cities with tailored discounts, regional ads, and partnerships with local delivery providers.
4.	Occasion-driven Promotions: Expand product lines for high-performing occasions (Anniversaries, Raksha Bandhan) and introduce exclusive offers for low-performing ones.
5.	Customer Retention: Since average customer spending is strong, introduce loyalty programs or subscription models to encourage repeat purchases.
6.	Delivery Optimization: Current average delivery time is 5.53 days; reducing this by even 1–2 days could significantly enhance customer satisfaction.
